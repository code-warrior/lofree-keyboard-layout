# Lofree Mechanical Keyboard Layout for Mac OS X
If you own a lofree Mechanical Keyboard, you’re aware of the fact that the numeric and the function rows have been shifted to the right by 1 key. This keyboard layout shifts the numeric row back to its original position, but leaves the function keys alone.

This keyboard layout was created using the [Summer Institute of Linguistics’ Ukelele Keyboard Layout Editor](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele).

6. You’ll have an icon in the menu bar, to the left of the clock, that you can now click to toggle input sources. Choose `U.S.--Lofree`

**Notes**: Toggling between windows is done with `ctrl` + `command` + `1`, and, the key with the backtick and the tilde is now in the slot to the left of the `delete` key. It acts as a placeholder in this layout, because that key is now mapped to a dead key.
